# Blackjack Project
The name of the game is Blackjack. First player to 21 wins. If you go over 21,
you automatically loose. After each game, you can choose to start a new game, or
quit. This is a two person game between the player and the dealer. The dealer is 
programmed to stay if his hand is equal to 17 or higher. 

# How to play
The game begins with a menu, asking if you would like to play blackjack or quit.
If you chose to play, the rules will pop up and the player/ dealer will be dealt 
two cards. You have two options, to hit or stay. If you hit and go over 21, The 
dealer will win. 

Once the game is over, you will be asked if you want to play, again. The deck 
of cards will shuffle and you can play, until you chose to quit. 

# Technologies Used
Java is the languaged used to create this program. The pillars of Object Oriented
Programming (abstract, polymorphism, inheretence, and encapuslatation) were used. 
Encapuslation was used to protect the deck of cards, the hand, and the player and
dealer. Polymorphism was used to create specialized behavior of the methods being
used. For this project we used a new technology called Enums. This was my first 
working with enums.


# Problem and Solutions
One of the biggest problems creating this project was the size of the project. 
This is the first time I have completed an OOP project of this size. There was a
total of 10 class files. Enitities included creating objects of Cards, Deck, Rank,
and Suit, which each deck of cards have. Each game has atleast one player and a 
dealer. I wasn't able to create more than one player and dealer at this time. 
This is something that I would have liked to do, but did not have enough time.
It did take me a while to connect all of the structures that I made. Blackjack
Table gave me a place to put the rules for the dealer and is where most of the
game is set up. It mimics real life to show where the game is played. With more time
and practice, this game did not feel as difficult as it did when I started programming 
it.
